Smart Agriculture System
========================
Through this project I have implemented a Smart Agriculture System. The aim of the project was to integrate technology with agriculture to meet the growing demands in this field. Smart farming through IoT can bring in a cost effective and reliable solution for efficient use of water. Soil moisture sensor reads data and sends it to Node MCU, A/D conversion of data takes place on the Node MCU. Data is then sent to the Blynk application through the wifi module ESP8266. If data is below a certain threshold, notification is sent to the user and the user can decide to turn on the water pump using the app. The app communicates with the Node MCU to trigger the relay connected to the pump. Thus the farmer can optimally use water depending upon the soil moisture content and even turn on the pump just using his smart phone.
